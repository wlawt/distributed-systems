## Notes

#### 8 fallacies (rules that should be always followed)
1. Make a reliable network
2. A network that has zero latency
3. Strive for infinite bandwidth 
4. Create a secure network 
5. Keep the topology consistent 
6. Only have 1 admin (single source of truth)
7. Utilize cost-effective solutions that make it almost "free" (resource & time wise)
8. Create a homogeneous network (all servers have same config)
